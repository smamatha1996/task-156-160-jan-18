        <p>In addition to capturing an image, it is often desirable to be able to augment an image with
a synchronized audio commentary and associated pen markings to describe specific
aspects of the patient’s condition. Hence, a multimedia annotation capability is offered
that can support this requirement and be stored along with the patient record.</p>
        <p>Current and future work includes conducting formal user studies with nursing practitioners from two home healthcare agencies to evaluate the usability and efficacy of the
devices and approaches described above to inform the subsequent iteration of the
prototype design.</p>
        <center><h2><b>Conclusions</b></h2></center>
        <p>The manner in which a networked enterprise can facilitate a plethora of ways for
healthcare personnel to communicate and collaborate was explored within this chapter.
The next generation of communication technologies augurs well for converged voice and
data solutions on a single network. We anticipate a closer union between healthcare IT</p>
        <p>systems and web-based communications. Technology innovation has spawned a proliferation of communication and data devices, such as GPRS cellular phones and PDAs,
and with it a significant opportunity for accessing clinical information anywhere,
anytime, allowing healthcare practitioners to collaborate upon clinical information and
reach conclusions more effectively.</p>
        <p>Throughout the chapter a selection of technologies has been presented that can enable
healthcare personnel to interact in a variety of styles. These approaches demonstrated
how multimedia technologies can be harnessed to capture information and enable users
to collaborate in range of modes in an effective manner. It was also described how the
knowledge captured during collaboration interactions can be saved and archived for
future search, reference and reusability. In addition, technology support for home
healthcare nurses is presented that shows potential for streamlining the capture and
entry of information into the patient record.</p>

        <p><i>The chapter introduces biomedical image registration as a means of integrating and
providing complementary and additional information from multiple medical images
simultaneously to facilitate diagnostic decision-making and treatment monitoring. It
focuses on the fundamental theories of biomedical image registration, major
methodologies and contributions of this area, and the main applications of biomedical
image registration in clinical contexts. Furthermore, discussions on the future challenges
and possible research trends of this field are presented. The chapter aims to assist in
a quick understanding of main methods and technologies, current issues, and major
applications of biomedical image registration, to provide the connection between
biomedical image registration and the related research areas, and finally to evoke
novel and practical registration methods to improve the quality and safety of healthcare.</i></p>
        <center><h2><b>Introduction</b></h2></center>
        <p>Clinical knowledge management is a challenging and broad discipline related to the
collection, processing, visualization, storage, preservation, and retrieval of healthrelated data and information to form useful knowledge for making critical clinical
decisions. As an important part of clinical knowledge, medical images facilitate the
understanding of anatomy and function, and are critical to research and healthcare.
Medical imaging modalities can be divided into two major categories: anatomical
modalities and functional modalities.</p>
        <p>Anatomical modalities, mainly depicting morphology, include X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US). Functional modalities,
primarily describing information on the biochemistry of the underlying anatomy, include
single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). With the advances in medical imaging technologies, these imaging modalities are playing a more and more important role in improving the quality and efficiency
of healthcare. For example, the functional imaging techniques can be used to image
physiological and biochemical processes in different organs, such as brain, lung, liver,
bone, thyroid, heart, and kidney (Figure 1). In such clinical settings, PET aids clinicians
in choosing the most appropriate treatment and monitoring the patients’ response to
these therapies. Since information from multiple medical imaging modalities is usually of
a complementary nature, proper extraction registration of the embedded information and
knowledge is important in the healthcare decision making process and in clinical practice.</p>
        <p>The combination of more advanced and user-friendly medical image databases is making
medical imaging results more accessible to clinical professionals. Starting in the early
1990s, the Visible Human Project and Human Brain Project at the US National Library of
Medicine have produced a widely available reference of multimodal images of the human
body. These projects provide users with labeled data and the connection of structural anatomical knowledge with functional-physiological knowledge (Ackerman, 2001; Riva,
2003), and assist in making image data more usable for clinical training and surgery
simulation and planning. A significant step in these virtual reality projects is the
collection and registration of medical images from multiple imaging modalities.</p>
        <p>Clinical practice often involves collecting and integrating considerable amounts of
multimodality medical imaging data over time intervals to improve the optimization and
precision of clinical decision making and to achieve better, faster, and more cost-effective
healthcare. For example, in neurosurgical planning, the proper registration of the
functional information with the detailed anatomical background enables the surgeon to
optimize the operation with minimal damage to the healthy organs. The accurate and
efficient registration of the complementary information available from different imaging
modalities provides a basis for diagnostic and medical decision-making, treatment
monitoring, and healthcare support.</p>
        <p>A key issue in clinical knowledge management is biomedical image registration, which
provides an effective mechanism to integrate the relevant information and knowledge in
clinical and medical decision-making, operation planning, and image guided surgery.
Registration algorithms also offer new possibilities to analyze and visualize multimodal
image datasets simultaneously.</p>
